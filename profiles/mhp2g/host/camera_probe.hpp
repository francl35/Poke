// MHP2G_FIND_CAMERA: finds the guest variables the game keeps its camera in.
//
// The game's camera is only observable from outside through the view matrix it
// uploads to the GE, which MHP2G_TRACE_CAMERA turns into a yaw and a turn per
// frame. This walks guest RAM alongside that measurement and keeps only the
// words that stay in a fixed proportion to it: a word that always equals
// c * turn is the camera's own turn rate, and one whose change always equals
// c * turn is the camera's angle. Everything else in 32 MB fails within a few
// frames.
//
// Set MHP2G_FIND_CAMERA=1 and turn the camera; the surviving addresses are
// printed as they thin out. PSPRECOMP_WATCH_WRITE=<address> then names the
// guest code that writes one.
