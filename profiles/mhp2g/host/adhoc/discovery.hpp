// Finding a hosted session on the local network, and the addresses a host can
// be reached at.
//
// A host announces itself once a second by UDP to port 27314: to the
// broadcast address of each of its IPv4 interfaces and to the multicast group
// 239.255.27.14 on each of them, so it is heard on a LAN and on VPNs that
// carry broadcast or multicast (ZeroTier, Hamachi). Instances looking for a
// host listen on that port. For VPNs that carry neither (Tailscale, most
// WireGuard setups) the player types the host's address; a query sent to that
// address, to UDP on the host's adhocctl port, is answered with the same
// announcement, so the typed address can be checked before joining.
//
// Every packet is little-endian and at most 64 bytes, well within any VPN's
// MTU:
//
//   offset size
//   0      4    magic "YKAH"
//   4      1    version, 1
//   5      1    kind: 1 announcement, 2 query (a query ends here)
//   6      2    adhocctl TCP port (the relay is on the next port)
//   8      2    relay TCP port
//   10     1    players logged in to the host's server
//   11     1    reserved, 0
//   12     4    session: a random number the host keeps while it hosts
//   16     10   product code, NUL-padded (ULJM05800)
//   26     32   host's name, UTF-8, NUL-padded
//   58          end
//
// The host's address is where the packet came from.
//
// Threading. One thread of its own sends, receives and looks up interfaces;
// the calls below only exchange state with it under a mutex.
