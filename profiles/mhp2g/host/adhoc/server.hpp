// A PSP ad hoc server: the adhocctl matchmaking service and the relay that
// carries the game's datagrams and streams (see protocol.hpp), so one player
// can host a session for the others with nothing else installed. Other
// clients of these protocols, such as PPSSPP, can use it too.
//
// It was written for this project from the protocols' documented and observed
// behaviour:
//
// adhocctl. A client logs in with its MAC, nickname and product code, then
// joins one group at a time. Joining tells the newcomer about everyone already
// in the group and everyone about the newcomer, then confirms the join with
// the group's host MAC (whoever created the group). Leaving, or losing the
// connection, tells the others. A scan lists the groups of the client's game,
// then says it is complete. A client silent for 30 s is dropped; a new login
// with a MAC already logged in replaces the older connection.
//
// Relay. Each connection opens with an init record naming one ad hoc socket.
// A datagram socket's datagrams go to the datagram socket with the MAC and
// port they name, or, sent to the broadcast MAC, to that port on every other
// member of the sender's group. A stream connection waits up to 5 s for a
// listening socket on its destination, tells that socket who is connecting,
// and then waits up to 5 s more for the accepting connection. Once paired,
// both sides are told and their data is passed through; when either closes,
// the other is closed after what it was sent has been delivered.
//
// Threading. start() binds the listening sockets on the calling thread, which
// takes no time, and everything else runs on one network thread of the
// server's own. stop() closes every connection and joins that thread.
