// The on-screen keyboard: a grid of keys drawn by the interface layer, for
// entering text with a gamepad alone. A physical keyboard types into it at the
// same time, and the mouse can click its keys.
//
// Gamepad: the D-pad or left stick moves over the keys, confirm types the key,
// back deletes, the left face button is Shift (once, then Caps, then off), the
// top face button types a space, Select/View switches to the symbols page,
// L1/R1 move the text cursor and Start is OK. Confirm is the face button the
// menu's "Confirm button" setting names.
//
// Keyboard: typing, Backspace, Delete, the arrow keys, Home, End, Enter (OK)
// and Esc (cancel).
//
// It is used in two places. Inside a screen that is already running, such as
// the in-game menu: open it, then call text_input_frame() from the screen's
// frame in place of drawing the screen until it closes. Over the running game,
// for the game's own keyboard requests: open_game_text_input() takes the pad
// from the game and draws the keyboard with every presented game frame.
