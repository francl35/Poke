// chip: confirm rebinds it, the top face button, Delete, a right click or its
// × clears it. A "+" chip adds one more, and a reset chip puts the action
// back as the preset it was made from has it. Conflicts are listed under
// their action with a one-click fix. Works with a gamepad alone, a keyboard,
// a mouse and touch.
