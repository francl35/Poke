// Fast-forward (#166): while the player holds its bind, or after toggling it,
// emulated time runs a set number of times faster than real time.
//
// There is no second clock. The kernel's hold of emulated time to real time
// (Kernel::pace_to_real_time) lets emulated time run `speed()` times as fast
// as real time, the way fast loading lets it run ahead during a load
// (kernel/fast_loading.hpp). Every vblank still comes kVBlankPeriodUs of
// emulated time after the one before, so the game runs each of its frames,
// its timers and its sound thread exactly as a PSP would; they only arrive
// sooner in real time.
//
// While it runs, the game's sound is not played (the buffers are dropped, as
// a fast load drops its silence), the window shows a flip at most about 30
// times a second, frame interpolation waits, and a small indicator is drawn
// over the game by the interface, never into the game's own frames.
//
// Single player only: during ad hoc play the other players' time is real, so
// the bind does nothing there, and a press says so once on the console.
