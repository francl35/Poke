// Fast loading: emulated time runs ahead of real time while the game loads,
// and only then.
//
// The disc reads themselves are instant here, yet a load takes as long as on a
// PSP: the game's loader threads read, check and unpack the data a piece per
// frame or so and wait on the emulated clock in between, which the kernel
// holds to real time. While a load is under way that hold is let go, so the
// load takes as long as the host needs for the work, not the PSP's time.
//
// A load is recognised from what the game does, not from a timer: it is
// reading the disc (DATA.BIN and the rest), and it is silent. Anything that
// could be gameplay keeps real time: sound coming out, a button held, a movie,
// the in-game menu, ad hoc play (other players' time must stay real) and the
// Game speed setting, which already lets time run free.
