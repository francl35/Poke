// Gamepad mappings for controllers SDL does not know (#147), without SDL, so
// the setup's logic is tested like the bindings.
//
// SDL drives a controller as a gamepad (buttons by place: south, east,
// shoulders, sticks) only when it has a mapping for it: a line that says which
// of the device's raw buttons, hats and axes is which, such as
//
//   03000000100800000100000000000000,PS1 Controller,a:b2,b:b1,dpup:h0.1,leftx:a0,...,platform:Windows,
//
// Without one the device is only a joystick, and neither the game nor the
// menu reads it. The Controllers screen asks the player to press each control
// in turn, turns the answers into such a line, and keeps it in
// gamecontrollerdb.txt in the data directory, the file format of SDL and of
// the community's SDL_GameControllerDB.

// pushed down "h0.4", axis 2 "a2", the positive half of axis 1 "+a1", and an
// axis read the other way round "a0~".
