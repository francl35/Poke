// Gives the game's 3D view the shape of the picture it is drawn into.

// NPJB-40001 only. The game keeps its projection's parameters in its camera
// object (the pointer at 0x08A2F958): near plane, far plane, aspect ratio and
// vertical field of view at +0x0, +0x4, +0x8 and +0xC. The aspect ratio starts
// as 480/272, a constant at 0x08969F74 that the camera's initialisation copies
// in, and the projection matrix and the camera's culling planes are both built
// from it. With another aspect ratio the game keeps its vertical field of view
// and widens (or narrows) the horizontal one, and draws that view into its
// 480x272 screen; the renderer then spreads the screen over the window.
