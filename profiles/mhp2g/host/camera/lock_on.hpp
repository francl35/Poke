// Lock-on (#163): a tap of the Lock on bind turns the quest camera towards a
// large monster and keeps it there while the monster moves.
//
// It is not a camera of its own. The follow camera's driver (game_camera.hpp)
// asks it, on every update of the game's ordinary follow camera, which yaw
// and pitch the camera should move towards, and moves the game's own angles
// there the way the analog camera does. The game keeps everything else: its
// collision checks, its presets for every other mode, and the hunter's
// movement, which stays relative to the camera as it always is.
//
// NPJB-40001, as traced in a quest (see the profile README):
// - The large monsters are a table of five pointers at 0x0A1B0AE0, in the
//   quest overlay's data (docs/DEBUG_MENU.md). Each object keeps its position
//   as three floats at +0x80, its health (s16) at +0x246 and its most health
//   (s16) at +0x288; a companion has no most health.
// - Bit 0x4 of the word at +0x4 of the object is set while the monster is in
//   an area other than the hunter's: 7 in four dumps with the monster
//   elsewhere (the hunter in a camp), 3 or 1 with it beside the hunter.
// - Each area has its own coordinates, and neighbouring areas overlap, so a
//   monster in another area can seem near; distance alone does not do.
// - The camera looks from its eye at +0x0 of the camera structure (s1 of the
//   camera update) to its look-at point at +0x10. Its yaw, in 65536ths of a
//   turn, puts the eye in the direction (sin yaw, cos yaw) from the look-at
//   point, so the camera looks along -(sin yaw, cos yaw). Checked in two
//   quests: yaw 7283 (40.0 degrees) with the eye at 40.0 degrees, 32768 with
//   the eye at 180.
