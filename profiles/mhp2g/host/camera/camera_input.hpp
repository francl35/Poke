// Two kinds of source feed it. A rate source (a stick, camera keys) holds a
// speed until it changes, as a fraction of Camera speed; the port turns that
// into degrees using the real time between frames, so a push means the same
// turn per second at any frame rate. A motion source (a mouse, a touch drag)
// adds degrees directly, once. Every source adds together, and whoever drives
// the game's camera takes the sum once per camera update.
//
// Signs: positive yaw turns right, positive pitch looks down, the way a
// non-inverted stick or mouse is pushed. Inversion belongs to each source.
