// The free camera (issue #162): the view detached from the game's camera and
// flown about the scene, for pictures, for looking at models and levels, and
// for debugging the renderer. Experimental, off by default.
//
// NPJB-40001, as traced with MHP2G_TRACE_VIEWS: every transformed draw of
// the village and of a quest area is made with one GE view matrix, and the
// game keeps that matrix in its camera object (the pointer at 0x08A2F958) at
// +0xF50, with a copy at +0xF90. The GE keeps 24 bits of each float, so the
// uploaded matrix is the kept one with the low 8 bits of every entry cleared.
//
// The free camera changes nothing the game can see. Game logic, the camera
// object, culling and level of detail run as before; only the draws whose
// view is the game's own get the free camera's view instead, on their way to
// the renderer (GeState::set_view_hook). Leaving hands every draw its own
// view again, so the game's camera is back exactly as it was.
//
// What the game culls against its own camera it never draws, so it is not
// in the picture from anywhere else either: see the profile README.
