// Saves through Android's document picker (#17). A folder the player picks
// is a tree of content:// documents, not a path, so the save screen works on
// local copies: an import copies the save folders it can find in the picked
// folder into a staging folder and checks them there as on any platform; an
// export or a backup is written to a staging folder and then copied into the
// picked one. Only in the Android app (MHP2G_ANDROID_APP).
