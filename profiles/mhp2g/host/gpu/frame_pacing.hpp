// When frame interpolation presents, what each present shows, and how many
// presents a second the machine can afford. Independent of the renderer and
// of the clock, so it can be checked on made-up timings.
//
// The game makes a frame every two vblanks of its 59.94 Hz display, 33.4 ms
// of emulated time. Each frame belongs to a moment of real time: the moment
// the kernel's hold to real time maps the flip's emulated time to. That
// moment is steady even when the game's code takes longer on some frames than
// on others, which the real time of the flip itself is not.
//
// Presents follow a grid of evenly spaced moments, `presents per frame` of
// them per game frame, aligned with the frames' moments: at 60 every frame's
// moment and halfway between; at 45 every other frame's moment and a third of
// the way into the ones between. Each grid moment is shown by a present made
// a fixed delay later, blending the two frames around the moment by where it
// falls between them. The delay is as short as it can be: a frame reaches the
// renderer when the game's code for it has run, some milliseconds after its
// moment, and the first grid moment past a frame's moment needs that frame.
// So the delay is the frame time less the shortest step from a frame's moment
// to the next grid moment, plus the time the game's code takes: the ninth
// longest of the last 60 frames, and a millisecond. A frame later than that,
// a stall or a load, holds the newest picture for a present or two rather
// than keep every present late for two seconds. At 60 a frame is on screen as
// it is 16.7 ms plus that time after its moment; without interpolation it is
// shown when its code has run.
