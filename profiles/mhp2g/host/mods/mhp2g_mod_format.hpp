// The mod folders this game's community already uses, so that mods made for
// mhp3reload and its mod manager work unchanged. Implemented from their
// published documentation and from the files themselves, not from their code
// (see docs/SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md):
//
// - A mod is a folder with a mod.ini whose [MOD INFO] section names it, its
//   Type, its Files, and for file and patch mods the Target file ids.
// - A file id is a DATA.BIN entry index in four upper-case hex digits.
// - A folder without a mod.ini that holds files named by file id (0601) and
//   patches named by file id and P (0601P), as mhp3reload's own files folder
//   does, is taken as one mod.
//
// Game-specific: the machinery that uses this is in mod_library.hpp.

// manager strips when it installs a patch; both forms are read).
//
// - A block for an address inside a code overlay's image (the overlay's
//   header gives where it loads) changes those bytes of the file, which the
//   game copies to that address unchanged.
// - A block for other guest memory is written there once the overlay has
//   loaded (FileContent::after_load).
// - A block whose address is smaller than the file is taken as an offset
//   into the file, for files that load to no fixed address.
// - A block marked to run as it loads (the top bit of its length) is code,
//   which this port cannot run that way; it is skipped and reported.
