// The font the game's text is drawn with. The PSP's system fonts live in the
// console's flash, which a dumped disc does not contain, so sceLibFont glyphs
// are rasterised from a TrueType or OpenType font on the host: the player's
// choice (settings text.font, or MHP2G_FONT), with a Japanese system font as
// the fallback for every glyph the chosen font lacks.
//
// How the game uses the glyphs, traced with MHP2G_TRACE_FONT=1:
//
// - It reads the font info once and sizes a glyph cell from the maximum glyph
//   width and height, each rounded up to an even number. A texture atlas of
//   256x256 pages holds the cells, one cell width apart horizontally and the
//   cell height plus 2 apart vertically.
// - Each glyph is rendered on its own into a cleared 20x20 buffer (4 bits per
//   pixel), and the whole buffer is copied into the glyph's atlas cell. With a
//   cell smaller than 20 pixels the copy spills into the neighbouring cells,
//   and at the right edge of a page it wraps into the cells of the next rows:
//   whichever glyph is copied later wins, so ink near a cell's edges is lost.
// - Half-width characters (Latin letters, digits, most symbols) are centred in
//   the cell by their bitmap width: x = (cell width - bitmap width) / 2,
//   rounded down; the left bearing is ignored. They are then drawn a second
//   time 31/64 of a pixel further left, which makes them bolder. Full-width
//   characters are placed at their bitmap left bearing.
// - The top of the bitmap goes to 1 + ascender - bitmap top, the ascender being
//   the font info's maximum glyph ascender.
// - Text is laid out in whole cells: a half-width character advances by half
//   the text size and a full-width one by the full size; the advances the font
//   reports are never read. Each character is drawn as a sprite showing its
//   whole cell (one of the game's text paths leaves out the last column and
//   row), squeezed into the character's advance.
//
// So the host reports a 20x20 maximum glyph, which gives cells that are as
// large as the buffer and never overlap, and fits every glyph inside the cell,
// away from its edges, by shifting it and, if it is still too large, scaling it
// down. The metrics reported are those of the bitmap drawn.
