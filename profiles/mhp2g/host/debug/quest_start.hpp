// Starting a quest from the developer tools: the village and Guild Hall
// quests the game has, read from its own quest lists, and a departure made the
// way the game makes one when the hunter presses the button at the village
// gate or the Hall's.
//
// The game keeps the accepted quest's id in the quest state beside the
// character (0x09FAF8C2). Departing is a scene change the village or the Hall
// asks for, through the same function for both: it writes the gate the hunter
// leaves by (which is also where the hunter comes back to), sets the next
// scene to "quest" and asks the scene to end. The quest overlay then loads the quest by its
// id, as it does after the counter and the gate, so the map, the monsters, the
// clock and the rewards are the game's own. docs/DEBUG_MENU.md says how each
// address was traced.
//
// Pure functions over a Ram and over file bytes, so the unit tests run them
// on buffers. Nothing here writes on its own: debug_tools.cpp calls these at
// the flip.
