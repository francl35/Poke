// Developer tools: the Debug page of the in-game menu (cheats for testing) and
// the command file that drives the same tools from a script. They exist only
// in developer builds: MHP2G_DEBUG_MENU is off in release builds, which then
// compile none of this, and a developer build shows them only when the
// environment variable MHP2G_DEBUG_MENU=1 is set.
//
// Nothing here writes guest memory from the interface directly. The menu
// queues a request; the requests run at the game's flip, between two game
// frames, on the thread that runs the game (debug::frame from present_frame).
// While ad hoc play is active the tools refuse to write anything, so a test
// never reaches another player's game.
