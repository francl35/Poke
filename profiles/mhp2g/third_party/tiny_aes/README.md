# tiny-AES-c

`aes.c` and `aes.h` are unmodified copies of [tiny-AES-c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c) at commit `23856752fbd139da0b8ca6e471a13d5bcc99a08d`, released into the public domain under the Unlicense (see `UNLICENSE`).

The installer uses it for AES-128 in CBC mode, through `host/install/executable_preparation.cpp`, and the save-data code for single AES-128 blocks, through `host/save_data/aes128.cpp`. The build compiles `aes.c` as C++.
